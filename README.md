git clone this repo into Applications/MAMP/htdocs on Mac
(on Windows, it's probably something like Program Files/MAMP/htdocs ?  I'm not sure, google it if that's wrong)

Next, point your browser to: http://localhost:8888/gnarcars/Symfony/web/config.php
This might be different on windows, not sure

You should see a Symfony 2 page.  Congratulations!
