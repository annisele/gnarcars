	 * 
	 * 		$user->opt["default_user"]["username"] = "Stranger";
	 * 
	 * You may change and customize all the options and configurations like
	 * this, even the error messages. By exporting your customizations outside
	 * the class file it will be easier to maintain your application configuration
	 * and update the class core itself in the future. Just remember to start
	 * the object with the first parameter 'false', new uFlex(false), to halt
	 * the object construction.
